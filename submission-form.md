## Submission details

### If relevant, explain any changes in project scope, direction, or participants since your initial entry. Please indicate N/A if there are no changes.

We have executed a pilot of the program to refine our proposition, identify risks, pinpoint new elements to introduce to the program, get feedback from participants, mentor, refine our surveys, and, most importantly, make sure we can continuously execute the BOSS program.

We invited girls attending a software engineering course, and we made an open call specifically to black woman coders on Twitter. We had 50 applicants, and we decided to restrict the pilot to 9 participants, with one mentor allocated exclusively to each participant. We invited 7 new members to the BOSS organizations, all women, ranging from undergraduates to software engineers with chatbot experience.

The mentors supported the participants, but they also guided live coding sessions and technical/theoretical online sessions. We had a meeting once a week to discuss the program and plan the tasks. With the new perspective brought by new members and the execution of the pilot BOSS program, we have the following changes on the project scope:
- We refined the roadmap of the activities of the program
- We proposed a set of fixed activities per week on the program
- We included a weekly mentor/mentee meeting (one-on-one) to discuss their individual expectations, necessities, impediments
- We had an interview series called "Talk like a Boss", done every 2 weeks, to discuss minorities' topics in the Software Industry and open source.
- We have tested several versions of a survey applied weekly to evaluate the participants' belief in their own competence, technical evolution, and motivation to contribute to open source.
- We have also tested several versions of a survey applied weekly to mentors to evaluate their perception of the mentorship


### Please share your marketing/outreach plan for attracting users.

For the pilot, we reached out to the organizers' personal network and their reach. We had the opportunity to present the project at the Brazilian digital Campus Party. It really helped us reach out to get people to apply to our mentorship. Besides that, we had our word spread by local communities focused on women or technology, such as a local branch of PyLadies and WIE.

During the pilot, we streamed our lectures live through youtube. We also share these videos on our social media so people who didn't get the chance to participate can still learn and stay in contact with our platform until the next mentorship period. Another important factor of our project presence in social media is the "Talk Like a BOSS" interviews, which helps us spread the word about other people's work in FOSS related areas and gain an online presence to invite people to get involved.

Next season, we plan to contact other local communities in Brazil, trying to make the area a more inclusive space for minorities. By getting in touch with them and gaining access to their communication methods(telegram, newsletter, etc) we plan on further spreading our initiative and content. Making presentations at local events is also a great way of attracting newcomers since it's an opportunity to show how our mentorship program works.


### What elements of your project/program are in place to encourage FOSS contributions not just once, but over a longer period of time?

We will tackle some lessons learned and documented by the FOSS community and academic research to understand newcomers' motivation to continue contributing to FOSS and why they stop contributing. First, the knowledge that newcomers are focused on self-enhancement and being mentored must offer a program roadmap that challenges the participants and gives continuous feedback checkpoints. Second, Stackoverflow surveys evidence that women and under-represented groups generally are more affected by the Competence-Confidence Gap.

The Big Open Source Sister is a 3-month mentoring program designed specifically for underrepresented groups, focusing on guiding through the basics of contributing to open source communities. The mentoring also focuses on dealing with Competence-Confidence Gap observed in the software industry, observed more severely in underrepresented groups, which affects their contribution to FOSS and their job. We list some Key Success Factors for our program to engage the participants to complete the program and continue contributing to FOSS:

- **Mentors**: in our pilot program, we had one mentor for each participant. The mentors are responsible for leading the technical sessions, helping in issues solving and pull requests revision, and having a one-on-one meeting with their protegé to share experience, get/give feedback, and engage the participant to be involved with the community. This close relationship with the mentor is the key success factor because it helps create a community around the program, identify and foster participants' motivations to contribute to FOSS, and boost participant confidence in their ability to contribute to open source. In the pilot program, we have only women as a mentor and as participants. We believe it minimizes any barrier between the participants and the mentors, creating a welcoming community.

- **Clear, objective, and feasible weekly tasks**: to keep participants engaged and challenged throughout the program, it is necessary to delegate achievable weekly tasks. It is especially challenging with technical unevenness between participants, once the only technical requirement to participate in the program is to have any programming skills. Again, the mentors are continuously adapting the week's task to challenge their protegé. Achievable goals/tasks increase participants' self-confidence and give them enough experience in finding feasible issues in a FOSS community.

- **Mentors training**: Before the mentorship program starts, we train the mentors to a welcoming FOSS onboarding process, such as recursive delegation techniques and effective one-on-one meetings. We also encourage them to explore other FOSS communities to study these communities' practices and eventually contribute.

- **Talk like a Boss**: our interviews "Talk like a boss" is essential to engage participants in contributing to FOSS in the longterm. First, we use the recursive delegation technique to empower participants to organize and lead the episodes. Also, we try to invite guests that advocate FOSS, introducing a variety of FOSS communities in different contexts.

- **Use mostly Open Source Tools**: The organizers of the initiative understand that the first step in contributing to a FOSS project is to understand the meaning of free and open-source software and understand how projects of this nature are built. We use primarily open source tools throughout the mentorship program. We have a live session to help participants installing and configuring their Linux distribution, and we have our live sessions using jitsi. Fostering "open source culture" is essential to build intrinsic motivation to contribute to FOSS. The final weeks are designed to encourage program members to participate in initiatives and events that aim to boost open source contributions worldwide, such as Outreachy, Hacktoberfest.

- **Communication in native language**: we designed the BOSS program to introduce Brazilian women and underrepresented groups into Free Open Source Communities. Since English can be a strong entry barrier, the entire program is in Portuguese, and we contribute to a local community, with all issues, technical, and pull requests documentation are written in Portuguese. It makes the program accessible to our target audience and shows that it is possible to contribute to the local FOSS community.



### While we recognize that each Phase One winner may be in a different stage of development, the judges would like an understanding of how viable your project will be. Please provide an overview of how your project/program will be accomplished. Suggested items to include: timeline, milestones, budgets, responsibilities, etc.

#### Milestones, activities, and timeline

The Big Open Source Sister (BOSS) is a 3-month mentorship program. However, one cycle of a BOSS program takes 5 months because the mentors have a month of preparation and training before welcoming the participants. We have 12 established milestones, with their particular goals, tasks, attributions, deliverables, and success criteria.

Since our submission to the first phase of the Gnome Community Engagement Challenge, we have executed a pilot program with 9 mentors and 9 participants, and we refined the proposed roadmap from our lessons learned. We will detail each Milestone and main deliverables next.

On the pilot of the program, the organizers of the BOSS invited the mentors. The invitation period took around 2 weeks, and we did it without any formal guidelines. We know we need a call for participation for mentors, with clear requirements and expectations. In the following program roadmap, we established one month for mentors' definition, but this Milestone will be refined in the program's next execution.

#### Deliverables
The deliverables of the BOSS project are a set of artifacts that serves as guidelines for the execution of the program.
We expect to propose a 3-month mentorship framework.
It intends to introduce FOSS practices to guide the participants' first contributions, technical tutorials to improve their skills, and material to enhance women's self-perception on their professional capacity through mentorship.

These are the deliverables that are done:
- **Training and tasks roadmap**: schedule containing activities, tasks, concepts and presentations.
- **Mentors good practices**: document with informations, such as 'what to approach on the one-on-one with your mentee', 'support unmotivated, discouraged participants', 'communicating efficiently', 'building a safe environment with your mentee, 'giving constructive feedback', and suggestions of feedbacks to improve participants self-confidence. [Mentor guidelines]
- **Self-assessment questionnaire template**: survey applied weekly to both mentors and participants to assess their perception about the program and track their self-confidence in contributing to FOSS communities.
- **Mentors meeting notes templates**: template with the checklist of the activities performed weekly by mentors. [Meeting notes template]
- **Interview script templates**: template with the list of the actions necessary to plan and host the episode. [Script template]
- **Lessons Learned/ post mortem**: we continuously discuss and register the lessons learned from our experience. We hope this shared experience can help other similar initiatives and continually improve the BOSS program.
- **Technical live sessions materials**: all material created for the live technical sessions are available in creative commons license. We have slides, slides templates, the live session recorded available on youtube. [Live sessions materials]

The below deliverables are planned or in progress:
- **Techniques for newcomers bonding**: one of the biggest challenges is to create a welcome community from the beginning. Doing it remotely is harder. We will test and suggest group dynamics techniques for different contexts and moments on the program. The goal is for all the members to know each other, exchange experiences, expectations, struggles, doubts, issues, and suggestions.
- **Survey analysis guidelines**: how to interpret the results of the surveys and how to address the most common issues raised by participants
- **Recursive delegation techniques suggestions to engage participants in the program and in the FOSS community**: Allocate participants to plan and present a podcast episode, invite participants to lead live technical sessions, record discussed issues. We will propose a set of tested recursive delegation techniques to both mentors and FOSS maintainers and how they engage newcomers into the community.

#### Stakeholders

We need a set of stakeholders to execute the BOSS program, which are:
- **Organizers**: the organizers of BOSS are responsible for evaluating the program continuously, share the vision/knowledge about the program, and invite/publicize the call for mentors, technical staff, and participants. They are also responsible for guaranteeing the conduct code and good FOSS practices.
- **Mentors**: we expect to have one mentor per participant. We look for mentors with various technical and nontechnical skills, and we do not establish objective criteria for their selection. The only restrictions are that the mentor must be from an under-represented group. TODO: tem uma frase faltando aqui... sobre convidar mentoras??
 - **Participants**: We will actively seek out women, regardless of race, black, LGBTQ+, and people in social vulnerability who report situations. Their learning environment has fewer people with similar identities and experiences, they have suffered discrimination or impediments during their professional development or found other barriers that prevented them from contributing to FOSS. It is expected that the participant had any prior experience in any programming language.
- **FOSS community Maintainers**: the program aims at contributing to a local Brazilian FOSS. The project, called "Rasa Brazilian boilerplate," is an architecture for an open-source chatbot configured to Portuguese. Therefore, we expect the maintainers to open issues for newcomers, answer questions in the communication channels, evaluate and give feedback to the merge requests.
- **Program leader**: the program leader manages the execution of the program. The leader organizes both mentors and participants meetings, prioritizes the programs issues to be done per sprint, review the documentation, and communicate with all participants the status of the program
- **Development team**: A small development team must evolve and maintain the BOSS program services - a website with the program's information, inscription forms, and monthly reports. They should also continuously deploy the BOSS chatbot, so the participants can test and implement new features to the project.

Both mentors, participants, and organization members are volunteers. Therefore, the program's cost is mainly related to the development team's cost and the cloud infrastructure to deploy our website and our chatbot project.

### How do you anticipate growing your project to incorporate other regions/individuals etc.

We have two main points essential for our project's growth: the replicability of our model by other communities and expanding our own mentorship program. They both rely on an essential artifact that we are trying to improve since our pilot experience: documentation.

Expanding our project to accommodate more participants is quite hard because of the nature of our mentorship. An essential aspect of the BOSS program is the participants' personal development, complementary to the technical skills that they will acquire. We decided to match a mentor with only one participant to follow their development more closely by having meetings every week to talk about goals, insecurities, etc. Having this close relationship between mentor and participant means that we cannot accept and accommodate more participants than mentors.

Having that in mind, we developed a Mentor's Guide document during this pilot run so that current and new mentors can have a tool to assist them in what to do, understand what is expected of them and provide recommended paths to take in conducting the mentorship. This will be an essential document that will be improved over time and will assist us by bringing more mentors to the initiative while still remaining a standardized mentorship quality.

Another critical aspect of our growth is the documentation of mentorship's entire process, step by step. Having it registered and with a guiding document recommending how to deploy our mentorship program will allow other communities to create their own mentorship, focusing on helping people from minority groups in their region.
