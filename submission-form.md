#### Deliverables
The deliverables of the BOSS project are a set of artifacts that serves as guidelines for the execution of the program.
We expect to propose a 3-month mentorship framework.
It intends to introduce FOSS practices to guide the participants' first contributions, technical tutorials to improve their skills, and material to enhance women's self-perception on their professional capacity through mentorship.

These are the deliverables that are done:
- **Training and tasks roadmap**: schedule containing activities, tasks, concepts and presentations.
- **Mentors good practices**: document with informations, such as 'what to approach on the one-on-one with your mentee', 'support unmotivated, discouraged participants', 'communicating efficiently', 'building a safe environment with your mentee, 'giving constructive feedback', and suggestions of feedbacks to improve participants self-confidence. [Mentor guidelines]
- **Self-assessment questionnaire template**: survey applied weekly to both mentors and participants to assess their perception about the program and track their self-confidence in contributing to FOSS communities.
- **Mentors meeting notes templates**: template with the checklist of the activities performed weekly by mentors. [Meeting notes template]
- **Interview script templates**: template with the list of the actions necessary to plan and host the episode. [Script template]
- **Lessons Learned/ post mortem**: we continuously discuss and register the lessons learned from our experience. We hope this shared experience can help other similar initiatives and continually improve the BOSS program.
- **Technical live sessions materials**: all material created for the live technical sessions are available in creative commons license. We have slides, slides templates, the live session recorded available on youtube. [Live sessions materials]

The below deliverables are planned or in progress:
- **Techniques for newcomers bonding**: one of the biggest challenges is to create a welcome community from the beginning. Doing it remotely is harder. We will test and suggest group dynamics techniques for different contexts and moments on the program. The goal is for all the members to know each other, exchange experiences, expectations, struggles, doubts, issues, and suggestions.
- **Survey analysis guidelines**: how to interpret the results of the surveys and how to address the most common issues raised by participants
- **Recursive delegation techniques suggestions to engage participants in the program and in the FOSS community**: Allocate participants to plan and present a podcast episode, invite participants to lead live technical sessions, record discussed issues. We will propose a set of tested recursive delegation techniques to both mentors and FOSS maintainers and how they engage newcomers into the community.
