### Please share your marketing/outreach plan for attracting users.


### What elements of your project/program are in place to encourage FOSS contributions not just once, but over a longer period of time?


### While we recognize that each Phase One winner may be in a different stage of development, the judges would like an understanding of how viable your project will be. Please provide an overview of how your project/program will be accomplished. Suggested items to include: timeline, milestones, budgets, responsibilities, etc.

#### Deliverables
The deliverables of the BOSS project are a set of artifacts that serves as guidelines for the execution of the program.
We expect to propose a 3-month mentorship framework.
It intends to introduce FOSS practices to guide the participants' first contributions, technical tutorials to improve their skills, and material to enhance women's self-perception on their professional capacity through mentorship.

These are the deliverables that are done:
- **Training and tasks roadmap**: schedule containing activities, tasks, concepts and presentations.
- **Mentors good practices**: document with informations, such as 'what to approach on the one-on-one with your mentee', 'support unmotivated, discouraged participants', 'communicating efficiently', 'building a safe environment with your mentee, 'giving constructive feedback', and suggestions of feedbacks to improve participants self-confidence. [Mentor guidelines]
- **Self-assessment questionnaire template**: survey applied weekly to both mentors and participants to assess their perception about the program and track their self-confidence in contributing to FOSS communities.
- **Mentors meeting notes templates**: template with the checklist of the activities performed weekly by mentors. [Meeting notes template]
- **Interview script templates**: template with the list of the actions necessary to plan and host the episode. [Script template]
- **Lessons Learned/ post mortem**: we continuously discuss and register the lessons learned from our experience. We hope this shared experience can help other similar initiatives and continually improve the BOSS program.
- **Technical live sessions materials**: all material created for the live technical sessions are available in creative commons license. We have slides, slides templates, the live session recorded available on youtube. [Live sessions materials]

The below deliverables are planned or in progress:
- **Techniques for newcomers bonding**: one of the biggest challenges is to create a welcome community from the beginning. Doing it remotely is harder. We will test and suggest group dynamics techniques for different contexts and moments on the program. The goal is for all the members to know each other, exchange experiences, expectations, struggles, doubts, issues, and suggestions.
- **Survey analysis guidelines**: how to interpret the results of the surveys and how to address the most common issues raised by participants
- **Recursive delegation techniques suggestions to engage participants in the program and in the FOSS community**: Allocate participants to plan and present a podcast episode, invite participants to lead live technical sessions, record discussed issues. We will propose a set of tested recursive delegation techniques to both mentors and FOSS maintainers and how they engage newcomers into the community.

#### Stakeholders

We need a set of stakeholders to execute the BOSS program, which are:
- **Organizers**: the organizers of BOSS are responsible for evaluating the program continuously, share the vision/knowledge about the program, and invite/publicize the call for mentors, technical staff, and participants. They are also responsible for guaranteeing the conduct code and good FOSS practices.
- **Mentors**: we expect to have one mentor per participant. We look for mentors with various technical and nontechnical skills, and we do not establish objective criteria for their selection. The only restrictions are that the mentor must be from an under-represented group. TODO: tem uma frase faltando aqui... sobre convidar mentoras??
 - **Participants**: We will actively seek out women, regardless of race, black, LGBTQ+, and people in social vulnerability who report situations. Their learning environment has fewer people with similar identities and experiences, they have suffered discrimination or impediments during their professional development or found other barriers that prevented them from contributing to FOSS. It is expected that the participant had any prior experience in any programming language.
- **FOSS community Maintainers**: the program aims at contributing to a local Brazilian FOSS. The project, called "Rasa Brazilian boilerplate," is an architecture for an open-source chatbot configured to Portuguese. Therefore, we expect the maintainers to open issues for newcomers, answer questions in the communication channels, evaluate and give feedback to the merge requests.
- **Program leader**: the program leader manages the execution of the program. The leader organizes both mentors and participants meetings, prioritizes the programs issues to be done per sprint, review the documentation, and communicate with all participants the status of the program
- **Development team**: A small development team must evolve and maintain the BOSS program services - a website with the program's information, inscription forms, and monthly reports. They should also continuously deploy the BOSS chatbot, so the participants can test and implement new features to the project.


### How do you anticipate growing your project to incorporate other regions/individuals etc.

We have two main points essential for our project's growth: the replicability of our model by other communities and expanding our own mentorship program. They both rely on an essential artifact that we are trying to improve since our pilot experience: documentation.

Expanding our project to accommodate more participants is quite hard because of the nature of our mentorship. An essential aspect of the BOSS program is the participants' personal development, complementary to the technical skills that they will acquire. We decided to match a mentor with only one participant to follow their development more closely by having meetings every week to talk about goals, insecurities, etc. Having this close relationship between mentor and participant means that we cannot accept and accommodate more participants than mentors.

Having that in mind, we developed a Mentor's Guide document during this pilot run so that current and new mentors can have a tool to assist them in what to do, understand what is expected of them and provide recommended paths to take in conducting the mentorship. This will be an essential document that will be improved over time and will assist us by bringing more mentors to the initiative while still remaining a standardized mentorship quality.

Another critical aspect of our growth is the documentation of mentorship's entire process, step by step. Having it registered and with a guiding document recommending how to deploy our mentorship program will allow other communities to create their own mentorship, focusing on helping people from minority groups in their region.
