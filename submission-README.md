Big Open Source Sister is a 3-month mentoring program for underrepresented groups, focusing on guiding through the basics of contributing to open source communities. The mentoring also focuses on dealing with Competence-Confidence Gap observed in the software industry, observed more severely in underrepresented groups, which affects their contribution to FOSS and their job.

##  Documentation

### Weekly

This program was organized in weekly cycles. Every week, we had this moments:
1. Meeting with mentors and organizers to prepare for the next week
1. Presentation with all participants to present the content for the week
1. Checkpoint with mentors to get feedback from mentorhips and adjust accordingly
1. One-on-one meetings for each big and little sister pair (mentor and mentee)

Each of them is explained in their templates and guidelines below.

### Talk like a boss

The `Talk like a boss` is a series of interviews. They are focused on real life and professional experiences of women in different areas, not limited to technical ones.
Their main purpose is inspire and motivate participants and mentors. To do that, we encourage both mentors and mentees to engange in writing scripts and hosting the show.

To help them we have an [issue checklist](https://github.com/BOSS-BigOpenSourceSister/BigSister/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/talk_like_a_boss.md) and a [script template](https://github.com/BOSS-BigOpenSourceSister/BigSister/tree/main/talk_like_a_boss/template_roteiro_entrevistas.md).
