# Big Open Source Sister

BOSS aims to reach underrepresented groups in tech who want to be mentored and assisted in learning how to work on open source projects. BOSS will provide a safe space and an accompanying methodology for them to learn basic concepts of working in a small open-source chatbot boilerplate project. The mentoring will focus on improving their technical skill and confidence to contribute to FOSS. The mentor team is composed only of women, with previous experience in both FOSS and developing chatbots. We will apply this project in Brazil, a country with significant social inequality, and we chose the theme chatbot because it has an increasing professional demand in the software industry. We will also focus the mentoring in dealing with Competence-Confidence Gap observed in under-represented groups in the software industry, which affect their contribution to FOSS and in their job.

- There was no question for gender identity
- There was no racial identity question
- There was no question for disabilities
