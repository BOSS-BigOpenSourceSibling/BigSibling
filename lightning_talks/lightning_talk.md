# **What is a lightning talk?**

Short talks, at most 5 minutes long, for whatever topic the speaker wants to cover. No need for slides, no technical skills needed. You can write down whatever you want to say. Make sure to be prepared for questions, we expect to have at least once or two per session!

ðŸ™‚

We want the lightning talks space to be a welcoming and healthy learning environment, where we can share experiences, passions, funny anecdotes, while practicing our foreign language skill, or even our speaking skills.

We are interested in positive, constructive feedback, we will not be complacent to whatever attitudes that are discouraging to whoever is sharing their time and experiences through the talks.

## How does it work?

Once a week, on the weekend, we will have one or two lightning talks. Speakers will be previously agreed upon, by whoever volunteers to speak on that day.

**Medium:** Sessions may be via Discord, Meet, or whatever other suitable platform. Speakers must... speak ðŸ˜œ

**Duration:** up to 5 minutes

**Topic:** free

**Language:** preferably English, but if you are practicing your ability to speak to audiences, you can use Portuguese, too. If you are not native to Portuguese but are trying to practice that language, you are also welcome to present in Portuguese ðŸ™‚ If you are learning Spanish/Castillan and want to practice that, we'll make our best effort to follow that, too! 

**Time:** agreed upon with participants

Audience: speakers, their friends, whoever can respect the guidelines. But we'll start with people we know, so we can feel comfortable with this experience.
