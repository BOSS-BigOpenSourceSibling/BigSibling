# Mentorship guide / How to mentor

## Introduction
In addition to technical skills, interdisciplinar knowledge is required to train a complete professional in the field of technology.
Contact with other developers in the programming area, with management in meetings, contact with customers, with users, communication is central to the success of a Software product.
Not only that, a critical look at the role of technology in society and the responsibilities of those who develop it are fundamental for creating more democratic and accessible systems.
The preparation in relation to trust, communication and career development also enable people to shield themselves from problematic situations in the job market, such as companies that have precarious work conditions or practices such as gaslighting.

Different people might think differently of what a successful mentorship is.
Setting expectations for both people helps them to act in the right direction for them.
Therefore, it is important to talk about various aspects and factors that impact them.
Some of the topics are listed and explained below.

Tell your mentee what are your 1-on-1 weekly meetings, what you will talk about, what they can bring to them, and why they happen.
They probably will happen online with duration of an hour.
So ask them if they are comfortable with having them in the platform you chose, and about the duration.
Make sure you can arrange time and space as necessary to run your meetings.
Besides the time you have for your 1-on-1 meetings, set your office hours and let your mentee know you will be available at those hours.
This will help you to not feel pressured to answer anything at inconvenient times.

Explain that 1:1 meetings will be a tool to adjust the pace of the program, to help them growing and evolving in their carrers.
It is important to have these meetings frequently, in order to keep track of problems and achievements, to keep them engaged and prevent them feeling lost.
Please let them know that, and try to make them comfortable to express their doubts, questions and challenges faced.
Explain also that your goal is to help them find the way they can keep progressing.
It is relevant to mention that this is a safe space.
Tell them it is acceptable to reschedule meetings, but do not forget to let you know,
specially if something unexpected happens.

You will share a lot of information in this first talk.
Writing them down will benefit you both.
You can have a shared document, on google docs or notion.so, for example.

### Weekly meetings

Tópicos que quero cobrir no texto:
- Keep track of achievements
- Ask questions
- Give examples
- Let them ask
- Plan your meetings ahead of time
- Give feedback
- Ask for feedback

These 1-on-1 meetings will require you to take some time to prepare.
Beware of how much time you spend weekly for this task, so you do not get overwhelmed.
Having in mind what you need to review, to read, to research will help you not to take so long in preparing.
Having a document to keep track of your notes, questions your mentee has asked, problems they have faced is a good option.

Ask about your mentee goals, always having in mind the goals of the project, so you can work with them.
With your mentee, break these goals into actionable tasks.
Accomplishing these tasks are reasons to celebrate and see the path they had to go through to achieve something.
Not being able to accomplish a task is common.
In such cases, it is important to try to understand what happened.
Was the task too complex, could it have been split into smaller ones?
Did the mentee lack any tools or knowledge, but felt unable to ask for help?
And, more importantly, how can their goals and path be adjusted,
when specific tasks are not finished? Is it time to rethink the scope of their
global goals, can you adjust overall schedule?
Help them undertand all possible strategies to cope with sitautions like these.

During your meetings, encourage them to ask you questions.
Even if you think you will not know the answer.
It is more important that you guide them through finding answers than giving them the answers right away.
While guiding them, try to give examples that are relatable to their context and experiences.
Remember that we aim to have mentees that can face problems and solve them by themselves, after the program.

Feedback is essential. Take time in your meetings to give feedback about how they are
doing, how the tasks might impact them on they career, how to manage and handle difficult situations.
Besides giving feedback, you should also ask for it.
You need to know how they are feeeling about the program, the meetings, the tasks
in order to rearrange and fix any issues that might come up.
