## Introduction
In addition to technical skills, interdisciplinar knowledge is required to train a complete professional in the field of technology.
Contact with other developers in the programming area, with management in meetings, contact with customers, with users, communication is central to the success of a Software product.
Not only that, a critical look at the role of technology in society and the responsibilities of those who develop it are fundamental for creating more democratic and accessible systems.

Different people might think differently of what a successful mentorship is.
Setting expectations for both people help them to act in the right direction for them.
Therefore, it is important to talk about various aspects and factors that impact them.
Some of the topics are listed and explained below.

Tell your mentee what are your 1-on-1 weekly meetings, what you will talk about, what they can bring to them, and why they happen.
They probably will happen online with duration of an hour.
So ask them if they are comfortable with having them in the platform you chose, and the duration.
Make sure you can arrange time and space as necessary to run your meetings.
Besides the time you have for your 1-on-1 meeting, set your office hours and let your mentee know you will be available at those hours.
This will help you to not feel pressured to answer anything at inconvenient times.

Explain that 1:1 meetings will be a tool to adjust the pace of the program, to help them to grow and to evolve in their carrers.
It is important to have these meetings frequently to keep track of problems and achievements, to keep them engage and not feel lost.
Please let them know that and try to make them comfortable to express their doubts, questions and challenges faced.
