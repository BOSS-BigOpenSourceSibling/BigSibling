## Introduction
In addition to technical skills, interdisciplinar knowledge is required to train a complete professional in the field of technology.
Contact with other developers in the programming area, with management in meetings, contact with customers, with users, communication is central to the success of a Software product.
Not only that, a critical look at the role of technology in society and the responsibilities of those who develop it are fundamental for creating more democratic and accessible systems.

Different people might think differently of what a successful mentorship is.
Setting expectations for both people help them to act in the right direction for them.
Therefore, it is important to talk about various aspects and factors that impact them.
Some of the topics are listed and explained below.

Tell your mentee what are your 1-on-1 weekly meetings, what you will talk about, what they can bring to them, and why they happen.
They probably will happen online with duration of an hour.
So ask them if they are comfortable with having them in the platform you chose, and the duration.
Make sure you can arrange time and space as necessary to run your meetings.
Besides the time you have for your 1-on-1 meeting, set your office hours and let your mentee know you will be available at those hours.
This will help you to not feel pressured to answer anything at inconvenient times.

Explain that 1:1 meetings will be a tool to adjust the pace of the program, to help them to grow and to evolve in their carrers.
It is important to have these meetings frequently to keep track of problems and achievements, to keep them engage and not feel lost.
Please let them know that and try to make them comfortable to express their doubts, questions and challenges faced.
Also explain that your goal is to help them find the way they can go.
It is relevant to mention that being a safe space, it needs honesty, specialy if something unexpected happen and one of you need to reschedule your meetings.

You will share a lot of information in this first talk.
Writing them down will help you both.
You can have a shared document, on google docs or notion.so, for example.

### weekly meetings

Tópicos que quero cobrir no texto:
- Keep track of achievements
- Ask questions
- Give examples
- Let them ask
- Plan your meetings ahead of time
- Give feedback
- Ask for feedback

These 1-on-1 meetings will require you to take some time to prepare.
Beware of how much time you spend weekly for these task so you do not get overwhelmed.
Having in mind what you need to review, to read, to research will help you not take so long preparing.
Having a document to keep track of your notes, questions your mentee have asked, problems they have faced is a good option.

Ask about your mentee goals, always having in mind the goals of the project so you can work with them.
With your mentee, break these goals into actionable tasks.
For example, if the goal is blablabla the tasks might be blablabla.
Accomplishing these tasks are reasons to celebrate and see the path they had to go through to achieve something.
Not being able to accomplish a task, is normal. blablabla pensar em um plano b blablabla

During your meetings, encourage them to ask you questions.
Even if you think you will not know the answer.
It is more important you guide them through finding answers than giving them the answers.
blablabla faça perguntas direcionadoras para as respostas blablabla
While guiding them, try to give examples that are relatable to their context and experiences.
Remember that we aim to have mentees that after the program can face problems and solve them.

Feedback is essential. blablabla pede feedback das reuniões, do programa, do projeto, das tarefas, etc blablabla.
blablabla Dê feedbacks sempre blablabla
