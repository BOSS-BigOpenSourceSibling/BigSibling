# Code of conduct

In order to make it clear what is expected, it is required that all participants, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any BOSS event comply with this Code of Conduct. The people who organize will enforce this code before and during the event.

## Summarizing 
BOSS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free training experience for all people, regardless of gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any way.
Sexual content and images are not appropriate in any part of the training, including lectures.
Be kind to other people. Do not insult or discourage other participants. Behave professionally. Do not post photos of other people without their consent. Remember that harassment, gender identity, sexism, racism and exclusion jokes are not appropriate for BOSS.
Conference participants who violate these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the seminar without refund, at the discretion of the training organizers.

### Long version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, harassment, hexing, harassment photographs or recordings, continuous interruption of lectures or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwanted sexual attention.

Participating persons who are asked to stop any harassing behavior must comply immediately.

Be careful with the words you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, transphobic, homophobic and other jokes are offensive to others around you. The use of offensive language and jokes is not appropriate for BOSS.

If a person engages in harassing behavior, the people organizing the training will be able to take all measures they deem appropriate, including alerting the author or expelling them from training.

We expect participating people to follow these rules in all locations of workshops and training-related events.

## Reporting Harassment

If you are harassed, notice that another person has been harassed, or have other concerns, please speak to your trainer or one of the organizers immediately.

The team is well informed on how to handle the incident and how to deal with the situation. Conference organizers will be happy to help participators  to contact local security or help ensure compliance with local law, provide escorts, or help those who have experienced harassment feel safe throughout the training. We value your presence.
