The BOSS mentorship program is focused on diversity in Software, specifically Free Open Source, and understanding why the need for this program is fundamental for an active and conscious participation in our community.

The first step is to recognize that education, processes, tools and technology products are not inclusive. There are several researches that show that our area is very homogeneous, with the majority of developers being straight white men, without children and without disabilities, and these are the people who shape the Industry. And so, technology is far from the imagined utopia, as neutral and a safe space. It has become an extension of power relations related to race, gender, also perpetuating oppression beyond these two dimensions, also reaching people with children, with disabilities, people with different sexual orientations and less privileged social classes.

There are several initiatives that try to combat the biases that permeate technologies. We have as an example of a large community the Pyladies. But why then another community, like BOSS, which also focus on python technologies?

Pyladies arose in the United States, and although it has been updated and adapted to different regions, as we have Pyladies Brazil, it was created with a group in mind, already privileged.

BOSS arises in a Brazilian context, with the understanding that there is a different context in the southern hemisphere, recognizing for example that a barrier in our country is the difficulty of access for learning the English language, which is widely used in programming languages. Even more specifically, BOSS focus  on Free Open Source, a branch of the Software Industry that has many barriers for contributors who are not part of the already homogeneous group in the area.

We need several groups that work with diversity, from different perspectives, so that we can enrich the debate, and also the technologies developed, so that they become more inclusive, and not control tools.
