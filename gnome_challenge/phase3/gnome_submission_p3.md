## Briefly explain your project concept in 200 words or less. Please provide an overall project recap that highlights your vision of the project in a succinct and engaging way. This could include: what the project is/does; who the project is for; what challenges the project is addressing; what the goals of the projects are, etc. 

The BOSS initiative aims to reach underrepresented groups in tech who want to be mentored and assisted to learn how to work on open source projects. We will provide a safe space and an accompanying methodology for them to learn basic concepts of contributing to an open source project in practice. Besides the technical aspects of introducing newcomers to open source, we have mentoring to deal with some challenges to inclusion, namely, intersectionality and impostor syndrome faced by the underrepresented. The mentoring process helps build confidence, filling in technical gaps, and engaging the participants. In BOSS, we expect participants who embody diverse characteristics and measure their own qualifications and competence. And it is not only about letting people in; little siblings must believe they can be successful and have corroborating experiences. Retention is a big part of the BOSS initiative. 

## Explain any changes in project scope, direction, or participants since your initial entry. Please include why these adjustments were made. If no changes were made, please include a brief explanation for your decision to "stay the course".

Since the first submission of the initiative, we have executed one program pilot, and we have more women becoming members of the organization. We have lessons learned from the pilot, new perspectives from new members, which helped improve the program. We highlight the main changes:

- **We changed the name of the initiative** - Now we are Big Open Source Sibling. We realized the previous name was not inclusive to other underrepresented groups and was gender-oriented. We believe the new name reflects better the values of the initiative;

- **We refined the milestones and the program roadmap to be easier to reuse and scale** - The goal is to allow the initiative to scale and use different onboarding open source projects. In our pilot project, we used a chatbot boilerplate local open source project. However, any other open source project can be used, with the requirement of having a maintainer or contributor guiding the onboarding process. We adapted the roadmap to incorporate these changes, be more generic and establish clear goals, success metrics, and tips;

- **We refined the mentorship roles** - from our lessons learned and gnome feedback, we observed mentors do not have availability to dedicate 5 hours a week to the initiative. Therefore, we defined more roles in the initiative so volunteers could dedicate only the amount of time they have available, making the initiative sustainable. We established objective expected profiles, dedication, and assignments into the initiatives;

- We also add a phase to the initiative, called **"What'’ next? Finding your favorite OSS project to contribute"**,  to introduce the participants to various other FOSS communities and encourage them to contribute to FOSS once the initiative ends. In this phase, maintainers, and contributors from various FOSS projects present workshops to onboard the participants into the FOSS communities.

## As a free software sponsored project, what FOSS software helped support this program and its participants? 

We encourage the participants to adopt and use open source solutions. Among, but not limited we introduce them to the following:

- We've used Jitsi to meet with the participants, and to stream the lectures. 
- OS Linux distribution - we have a live coding to install and configure a OS linux distribution (last season we guide the installation of Ubuntu) 

- OSS programming IDE -  VScode/vim

- OSS machine learning chatbot boilerplate - The boilerplate uses the following OSS solutions: Rasa chatbot framework, elastic search, rocket.chat, telegram.

- Inkscape/Gimp for image editing

## How has your community (users, contributors, etc.) grown since you started your project? What will you do to grow and manage the community that has formed around your project.  

We started the initiative with four women and one idea. Today, we have 16 women participating in the organization of the program and more than 10 women that participated as little sisters on the first edition of the BOSS initiative. 

## One goal of the Challenge was to reach and engage an under-represented group (or groups) in the FOSS community. Please share how your project addresses the barriers that underrepresented groups face and how you know they are being reached.

In the BOSS program, besides the technical aspects of introducing newcomers to open source, we deal with some challenges to inclusion, namely, intersectionality and impostor syndrome. Intersectionality demonstrates how diversity dimensions, such as gender, race, ethnicity, and disabilities, are not mutually exclusive categories but intersecting ones. Impostor syndrome refers to a person's experience of feeling like an intellectual phony despite having the expected credentials. Impostor syndrome is most often experienced by women, but it also affects other minorities. Under-represented groups tend to have impostor syndrome, and they won't contribute or apply for a job unless they have all the skills. We want to raise awareness that impostor syndrome can be a consequence of repeatedly facing systemic racism and bias.

In the BOSS initiative, these are central aspects. We address them in various ways:

- Providing applicants clearer information about the skills they need to apply
- Competence-confidence gap and the career mentoring
- Technical gap and the onboarding process
- FOSS communities practices and the community bonding
- Language and local mentoring 
- All mentors also belong to some under-represented group


## What elements of your project/program are in place to encourage FOSS contributions not just once, but over a longer period of time? How are these elements being tracked?

Within the BOSS program, there is the community that we use to onboard participants, and make them contribute to it. In the last two weeks of the program, we bring other FOSS community ambassadors to introduce their community and projects to participants. We encourage them to contribute to these or any other FOSS community and choose issues to work on. During the mentorship sections, the mentor encourages and helps the participant in finding a FOSS project with the technologies and community aligned with the participants' ambitions. Besides that, we invite participants to mentor or organize the next season of the program.  


## Please share how your project has evolved since the start. Where is it now? What are your next steps for expansion to incorporate other regions/individuals etc?

We started as a local initiative, aiming to solve problems we noticed in our local tech community, concerning representative, impostor syndrome, language barrier, and social/economic struggles that limit participants' engagement in tech programs. We have executed a pilot program, with only women in both organizations and participants, from different cities in Brazil. We had a list of lessons learned, alongside gnome judges' valuable feedback. We have a long road ahead until the program reaches full maturity. Now, we have achievements to celebrate:

- We view BOSS more as a framework for mentoring than the mentoring itself. We refactor the program roadmap and the current version could be used by any other FOSS community. We continually add materials to assist the mentors.
- We have run the program pilot before delivering the gnome phase 2. It was fundamental to improve the program, have feedback from the participants, and see that the impact of the program is much greater than we expected. We are very grateful to the participants that trust the program!
- We have 16 women working on the organization of the second season of BOSS. These incredible women have incredible stories, different backgrounds. We have women still in college, recently graduated, working in the FOSS industry, developers in various organizations, tech leaders in various big tech companies in Brazil, organizers/participants in renowned world FOSS mentorship programs. They contribute to new perspectives for the program, a realistic view on the Brazilian software industry to under-represented groups, and up-to-date practices.
- We share our experiences with several women tech and FOSS communities. These encounters also create a collaboration network that could help promote BOSS participants and mentor calls.
- We realized being a mentor and organizing the initiative takes a lot of time. We suffer in the first season with some mentors feeling overwhelmed with too many attributions. We refined the mentors' and organizations' roles, with dispersed responsibility and time box dedication. In this new format, we have mentors, organizers, collaborators, FOSS advocates dedicating fewer hours to the initiative, making it more sustainable. 
- The second season of BOSS already began! We open the mentors call, and we expect the second season will have a greater number of participants/mentors.
- Our issue templates help new members onboarding in the organization.

We have also mapped our next steps:

- Have our own webpage - we have planned to use the gnome prize money to create our website
- Enrich mentors and participants documentation
- Build partnerships with FOSS communities and software companies to finance the participants 
- There is a company in Brazil using BOSS methodology to bootcamp and prepare people from under-represented groups to apply to their open positions. We've been talking to them to collect feedback and trying to help them have better results
- During a few talks about BOSS, people from other countries showed interest in running BOSS in their context. So we plan to help them send them our documentation about executing it and help them adapt if needed. And use this feedback to improve our plans and documentation so it becomes easier for other people to use this methodology.
- Translate the BOSS documentation to english.
