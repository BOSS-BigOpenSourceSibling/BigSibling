# Milestones

This document describes the tasks, their inputs, outputs, and the objectvies of each of them.
It is important to emphasize that the steps mentioned here do not happen linearly.
Most of them will happen at the same time as some of the others.
To visualize how they take place in a timeline, see the milestones document.

## Carreer mentors selection

**Duration:** 4 weeks

Selecting the mentors requires 4 weeks of preparation.
Two of them being the mentors applying period. (Applications open)
In the first week of this time frame, the application form needs to be created.
In the last week the mentors are selected and the results must be communicated.

There are some basic info you need to provide for people analyse if they are going to apply.
Specify in the informational text the deadlines, the schedule and the responsibilities the will have if selected.
Do not forget to ask if they are available for this schedule.

The application form needs some basic information of the applicants,
such as social name, pronouns,
contact - email, phone number, telegram username, for example.
Being an inclusive and diverse program, we encourage having fields such as
race/ethnicity in the interest of selecting diverse people as an affirmative action.
Be responsible and research if there are terms in your language that might seem
innocent but might carry a disrespectful meaning torwards any group.

There are criteria for the choice of the mentors that will be specific to your context and project.
A few things to have in mind, how many mentors and participants in the program,
how diverse is your selection, the experience of the applicants.


## Mentor training

**Duration:** 8 weeks

In the first 4 weeks, alongside with the selection mentioned above,
construct the material you will need to present to your mentors.
This will even up your mentors knowledge about different topics during the program.
Be ready to tell to your mentors what is the BOSS program, what topics to cover on 1:1,
showcase the community that will be presented as example during the biggest part of the program,
what are free and open source communities and how to get information about them.
Do not forget to mention about diversity topics - since BOSS is a group focused
on subrepresented groups, talking about the challenges that these groups face is
essential, so that the mentors have a sympathy towards each mentee's social
vulnerability.
This will in turn help bring mentees closer to open source communities,
since the prejudice that they face often disencourage them to take part in communities.
In the next 4 weeks, will take place the demosntration about the before mentioned topics.


## Participants selection

**Duration:** 4 weeks

The work to be executed here is very similar to the `carreer mentors selection`.
Selecting the participants also requires 4 weeks of preparation for the same reasons.
Two of those weeks are for the applications to be open.

Provide information about when the results will be communicated,
how much dedication time is needed, if there are any prerequisites,
the objectives of the program, and ask them if they are available.

The information about the applicants you need to get from the form are social name,
pronouns, contact - being email, phone number, username in a messaging platform,
the race/ethnicity field is also important for participants.


## Establish content schedule

**Duration:** 2 weeks

- Review the program roadmap;
- Align with the technology mentor.

## Content schedule

**Duration:** 12 weeks


### Welcome to BOSS

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Goal:**
The goal of the welcoming phase is to introduce both mentors and little siblings to the program,  provide a safe space, and present the basics of Open Source Contributions. We have weekly workshops to introduce git, local environment configuration (installing Linux distribution, IDE, open source working tools). We assign every week small and repetitive tasks to help little siblings master specific skills (using git, repositories, open source toolsets) and gain confidence before they move to more complex tasks.

Each little sibling is assigned to one mentor for the entire program. They have weekly one-hour one-on-one meetings. During the welcome phase, these meetings should focus on mapping the little siblings' interests, expertise, motivations, ambitions, areas of improvement, and struggles. 

**Success Metrics:**
- The participants have their work environment configured correctly (pair program with the mentor, if necessary);
- The participants concluded the git exercises;
- Communication channels (telegram group, issues) are used correctly;
- The participants' interests, expertise, motivations, ambitions are mapped.

**Tips:**
- Employ the Strategy "Recommend Repetitive Tasks" - we use this strategy to help little siblings master git skills and gain confidence before moving to more complex tasks. We have weekly assignments, asking them to:
    - Update the Readme of their personal github page;
    - Open a pull request in  https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art;
    - Open/comment on a issue of BOSS repository.
- Establish from the beginning of the program a fixed workshop schedule (weekday, time), with a time-box duration. Being able to organize their time in advance is crucial to keep participants engaged.
- Use as many as possible Open Source tools. It introduces the participants to the FOSS ecosystem and different communities.  
- Assigning little Siblings with mentors - when women are mentored by other women, they report feelings of inspiration, solidarity, sisterhood, and a friendly environment. Therefore, it should be taking into account the intersectionality of gender, race, ethnicity, and disabilities, of both participants and mentors to make the match.
- Mentors should encourage little siblings to share their achievements with other participants. It fosters a welcoming community, with constructive feedback, collaboration, and anticipated difficulties participants might be facing.

**Suggested Technical Content:**
- Free Open Source history, philosophy, The four essential freedoms,Beyond Software (culture); 
- Git fundamentals;
- Local environment configuration (Linux installation, git install, IDE, dependencies);
- OSS Contribution Workflow (from issue communication to Pull Request).

### Overcoming Technical and non technical challenges of contributing to Open Source
**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Goal:**
The goal of this phase is to overcome the learning challenges of contributing to a particular Open Source Community. Each FOSS community has its specific technical challenges, like frameworks/libraries used, algorithms, architecture, among others. 
In this phase, we introduce the technical concepts necessary to contribute to the given FOSS community. For example, for the FOSS chatbot boilerplate, we introduce concepts like intents, utter, stories, natural language processing, custom actions in python, boilerplate architecture, among others. The general idea of each weekly workshop is breaking the code into sections and identifying the involved concepts/algorithms. Each week we have a workshop introducing the concepts, showing a practical example (show me the code) and an assignment with limited scope to be developed during the week in pairs. The pair programming technique is used to share knowledge among participants, but it also motivates participants to network and boosting self-confidence in sharing ideas. 

The goal of the one-on-ones in this phase is twofold: identify participants' difficulties in following the program and give them continuous feedback about their achievements. Additionally, the mentor can employ the recursive delegation technique to engage the participant in the program and give more attributions, according to their expectations and goals. We recommend some tasks the participants can participate in: lead a talk like a BOSS program (if they want to improve their communication skills), lead a technical workshop (if they have developed technically above average), improve the program documentation, anticipate the contribution to a FOSS community, among others (Read mentors documentation for more information).

**Success Metrics:**
- A participant runs the open source project in local environment;
- A participant can modify the FOSS project to a specific given context (Like create a chatbot for a given context);
- A participant enrolls in the workshops discussions;
- Participants pair program to solve proposed problems;
- A participant feel comfortable sharing with the mentor their struggles/difficulties;
- The participant feels comfortable in sharing their achievements in the workshop;
- The participant understands the importance of technical documentation in the FOSS ecosystem;
- The participant has set clear goals and expectations about the program and perceive her improvements.

**Tips:**
- Employ pair programming among participants and super pairing with technical mentors, if necessary;
- Dividing tasks into smaller pieces - Challenging tasks can create social fears in the newcomers;
-  Since participants can have different technical backgrounds, the mentor should monitor participants progress, and make sure they feel challenged and motivated;
- Assigning a small task first and then challenging the newcomers with bigger tasks. Each task assigned to participants should take up to 3 hours to be completed (2 hours of work outside the workshop is preferable). 
- Mentors should map how much each participant is looking to learn within a specific task, and adjust, if necessary, the tasks;
- If for any reason, the participant cannot dedicate enough time to the activities proposed, the mentor should make adjustments;
- Mentors should communicate with the organization about struggles and difficulties faced by participants so we can adjust the tasks/deliverables to fit participants expectations;
- The organization should analyze weekly the mentors and participants survey to identify improvements and use the data to refine the workshop planning.

**Suggested Technical Content (For the Boilerplate Season, details in our Gantt chart):**

In this phase, the technical content is very intrinsic to the project being presented.
- Run locally the project;
- Use it and feel see for themselves what is good and what is not;
- Contribute to documentation (quick start, install, for example);
- Basics of chatbot architecture;
- Basic concepts: intent, utter, stories, training dataset, custom action, python for custom actions;
- Create a simple chatbot project employing the concepts presented.


### Community Bonding
**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Goal:**
Now that the participants know the basics of contributing to FOSS, it is time to contribute to one FOSS project! In this phase, we have a maintainer of a local FOSS community guiding the participants through the process of contributing to a FOSS community. In community bonding, the maintainer will identify good first issues, reproduce bugs, discuss possible solutions, walk through the contribution process (implement a feature, test, open a pull request, communicate with the community, adjust contributions according to the feedback of reviewers), and review participants' merge requests. 
The goal is that each participant opens, at least, one pull request in this real FOSS local community. We encourage the use of a local FOSS community to avoid the language barrier (in our case Portuguese) and to foster projects with a high impact on the local community. 

**Success Metrics:**
- The participant contributes to the local FOSS project (their pull request is accepted);
- The participants feel confident about their abilities to contribute to other FOSS communities;
- The participants feel motivated to contribute to FOSS project(s);
- The participant understands the benefits from contributing to the FOSS project (self-enhancement, building portfolio, being mentored, interesting projects).

**Tips:**
- Advise participants in choosing issues consistent with their abilities and career goals;
- Present the contribution workflow of the FOSS community;
- You should have smaller tasks that are newcomer-friendly separated for the workshop;
- Make sure every participant has their local environment working correctly (if not, pair program with them to fix problems or have a specific live coding to configure the environment);
- Give constant feedback to the participants during the workshop and especially in issues/ pull requests;
- Review their work as soon as possible;
- Map issues for different skill sets (documentation, communication, implementation, bug fix);
- Check-in more frequently to see if the participant is blocked or stuck;
- Set up participants paired session to work on contributions; 
- Review draft contributions more frequently to ensure the participant is on the right track.


### What'’ next? Finding your favorite OSS project to contribute
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Goal:**
In the final 2 weeks of the BOSS, initiative participants are introduced to other FOSS communities. In parallel with the final 2 weeks of the Community bonding phase, we have onboarding workshops from various FOSS communities. Participants can choose one or many workshops to attend. We invite maintainers and contributors from different communities to lead these community bonding workshops. It is a 4-hour workshop (all at once, or distributed in two weeks, according to the availability of the speaker), to introduce the participants to a FOSS community, the main features and roadmap, the contribution workflow, and identify some good first issues. Optionally, live codings can guide participants to configure locally the environment (installation, test, dependencies) of the FOSS project. 
In these workshops, we hope to introduce the participants to a variety of FOSS communities, connect them with potential mentors from the communities, and encourage them to engage in the short/long term to contribute to Open Source. 

**Success Metrics:**
- The little sibling participates in at least one workshop;
- The participant express interest in continuing to contribute to Open Source;
- TThey feel more confident in pursuing their career goals;
- As they progress, their feelings of doubt should abate as their work and intelligence are validated over time. 

**Tips:**
- Many applicants have impostor syndrome, and they tend to not contribute to a project unless they have all the skills. Be clear about which skills are required, optional, or teachable, and what skill level is needed to contribute to your community;
- You should have smaller tasks that are newcomer-friendly. They should have a good description and contain links to relevant documentation;
- You should have smaller tasks that are newcomer-friendly separated for the workshop;
- Look for manageable tasks where there is community consensus on the solution;
- The participants had a first experience contributing to Open Source. Talk about the specifics of your community: communication channels, contribution workflow, tips to contribute for the first time, how the mentoring process works in this particular community.


## Talk like a boss

In parallel to the workshops and one-on-one mentorship, we have the Talk Like a BOSS. It is a biweekly thematic live event, and we discuss relevant topics of Software Engineering and Open Source, inviting women from the industry/FOSS community to share their perspectives. The goal of Talk Like a Boss is twofold. First, we can discuss topics relevant to the software industry and FOSS, from the perspective of under-representative groups. Second, we employ the technique of recursive delegation, with the participants planning and leading their lives. The planning of Talk Like a Boss requires study of the live topic, talk previously to the guest to adjust the details about the live content, write the episode script, with questions, guest bio, and finally, interact with the audience. We have a Script template to guide participants' planning, but we also have mentors available to train the participants in public speaking, help them prepare the material, and deal with technical difficulties.

**Success Metrics:**
- The participants are engaged to participate to Talk like a BOSS (as both audience or as host)
- 

**Tips:**
- Have a script to guide participants in planning the live event. Our talk like a boss script template can be found as an issue template in the BOSS organization; 
- Make sure the participants feel confident to lead the talk like a boss episode. Rehearse if necessary, review planning, give feedback
- Always have someone from the organization in the background, in case of any problem;
- Choose topics of interest for the participants. 


## Ending of the program

The closure of the program is a moment to look back, see what can be refined,
and celebrate achievements.
Take this moment to ask for more feedback from everyone involved, about the program, the mentorship, the lectures.
Ask for the mentors about their mentees achievements, and what challenges they overcame.
Use them to make a presentation to appreciate everyone's efforts - big and little siblings, and organizers.
Use screenshots of repositories growth, amount of PRs and issues.
You can use the insights tab on github to generate charts.
