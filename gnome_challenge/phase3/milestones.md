# Milestones

This document describes the tasks, their inputs, outputs, and the objectvies of each of them.
It is important to emphasize that the steps mentioned here do not happen linearly.
Most of them will happen at the same time as some of the others.
To visualize how they take place in a timeline, see the milestones document.

## Carreer mentors selection

**Duration:** 4 weeks

Selecting the mentors requires 4 weeks of preparation.
Two of them being the mentors applying period. (Applications open)
In the first week of this time frame, the application form needs to be created.
In the last week the mentors are selected and the results must be communicated.

There are some basic info you need to provide for people analyse if they are going to apply.
Specify in the informational text the deadlines, the schedule and the responsibilities the will have if selected.
Do not forget to ask if they are available for this schedule.

The application form needs some basic information of the applicants,
such as social name, pronouns,
contact - email, phone number, telegram username, for example.
Being an inclusive and diverse program, we encourage having fields such as
race/ethnicity in the interest of selecting diverse people as an affirmative action.
Be responsible and research if there are terms in your language that might seem
innocent but might carry a disrespectful meaning torwards any group.

There are criteria for the choice of the mentors that will be specific to your context and project.
A few things to have in mind, how many mentors and participants in the program,
how diverse is your selection, the experience of the applicants.


## Mentor training

**Duration:** 8 weeks

In the first 4 weeks, alongside with the selection mentioned above,
construct the material you will need to present to your mentors.
This will even up your mentors knowledge about different topics during the program.
Be ready to tell to your mentors what is the BOSS program, what topics to cover on 1:1,
showcase the community that will be presented as example during the biggest part of the program,
what are free and open source communities and how to get information about them.
Do not forget to mention about diversity topics - since BOSS is a group focused on subrepresented groups, talking about the challenges that these groups face is essential, so that the mentors have a sympathy towards each mentoree's social vulnerability. This will in turn help bring mentorees closer to open source communities, since the prejudice that they face often disencourage them to take part in communities.
In the next 4 weeks, will take place the demosntration about the before mentioned topics.


## Participants selection

**Duration:** 4 weeks

The work to be executed here is very similar to the `carreer mentors selection`.
Selecting the participants also requires 4 weeks of preparation for the same reasons.
Two of those weeks are for the applications to be open.

Provide information about when the results will be communicated,
how much dedication time is needed, if there are any prerequisites,
the objectives of the program, and ask them if they are available.

The information about the applicants you need to get from the form are social name,
pronouns, contact - being email, phone number, username in a messaging platform,
the race/ethnicity field is also important for participants.


## Establish content schedule

**Duration:** 2 weeks

- Review the program roadmap.
- Align with the technology mentor

## Content schedule

**Duration:** 12 weeks


### Welcome to BOSS

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Goal:**
The goal of the welcoming phase is to introduce both mentors and little siblings to the program,
provide a safe space, and present the basics of Open Source Contributions.
We have weekly workshops to introduce git, local environment configuration
(installing linux distribution, IDE, open source working tools).
We assign every week small and repetitive tasks to help little siblings master specific skills
(using git, repositories, open source toolsets) and gain confidence before they move to more complex tasks.

Each little sibling is assigned to one mentor for the entire program.
They have weekly one hour one-on-one meetings.
During the welcome phase these meetings should focus on mapping the little siblings interests,
expertises, motivations, ambitions, areas of improvements and struggles.

**Success Metrics:**
- The participants have their work environment configured correctly (pair program with mentor, if necessary)
- The participants concluded the git exercices
- Communication channels (telegram group, issues) are used correctly
- The participants interests, expertise, motivations, ambitions are mapped

**Tips:**
- Employ the Strategy "Recommend Repetitive Tasks" - we use this strategy to help
little siblings master git skills and gain confidence before moving to more complex tasks.
We have weekly assignments,  asking them to:
    - Update the Readme of their personal github page
    - Open a pull request in  https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art
    - Open/comment on a issue of BOSS repository
- Establish from the beginning of the program a fixed workshop schedule (week day, time), with a time-box duration. Being able to organize their time in advance is crucial to keep participants engaged.
- Use as much as possible Open Source tools. It introduces the participants to the OSS ecosystem and different communities.
- Assigning little Siblings with mentors - when women are mentored by other women, they report the feelings of inspiration, solidarity, sisterhood, and friendly environment. Therefore, it should be taking into account the  intersectionality of gender, race,  ethnicity and disabilities, of both participants and mentors to make the match.
- Mentors should encourage little siblings to share their achievements with other participants. It fosters a welcoming community, with constructive feedback, collaboration and anticipate difficulties participants might be facing.

**Suggested Technical Content:**
- Open Source
- Git
- OSS Contribution Workflow (from issue communication to Pull Request)

### Overcoming Technical and non technical challenges of contributing to Open Source
**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Goal:**
The goal of this phase is to overcome learning challenges of contributing to a
particular Open Source Community.
Each OSS community has its specific technical challenges, like frameworks/libraries used, algorithms, architecture, among others.
In this phase, we introduce the technical concepts necessary to contribute to the given OSS community.
For example, for the OSS chatbot boilerplate, we introduce concepts like intents, utters,
stories, natural language processing, custom actions in python, boilerplate architecture, among others.
The general idea of each weekly workshop is  breaking the code into sections and identifying the involved concepts/algorithms.
Each week we have a workshop introducing the concepts, showing an practical example
(show me the code) and an assignment with limited scope to be developed during the week in pairs.
The pair programming technique is used to share knowledge among participants,
but it also motivates participants networking, and boosting self confidence in sharing ideas.

The goal of the one-on-ones in this phase is twofold: identify participants' difficulties
 in following the program and give them continuous feedback about their achievements.
Additionally, the mentor can employ recursive delegation technique to engage the participant
into the program and give more attributions, according to their expectations and goals.
We recommend some tasks the participants can participate in: lead a talk like a BOSS program
(if they want to improve their communication skills),
lead a technical workshop (if they have developed technically above average),
improve the program documentation, anticipate the contribution to a OSS community, among others
(Read mentors documentation for more information).

**Success Metrics:**
- A participant runs the  open source project locally
- A participant can modify the OSS project to a specific given context (Like create a chatbot for a given context)
- A participant enrolls in the the workshops discussions
- Participants pair programm to solve proposed problems
- A participant feel comfortable to share with the mentor their struggles/difficulties
- The participant feels comfortable in sharing their achievements in the workshop
- The participant understand the importance of technical documentation in OSS ecosystem
- The participant has set clear goals and expectations about the program and see her improvements

**Tips:**
- Employ pair programming among participants and super pairing with technical mentors, if necessary;
- Dividing tasks into smaller pieces - Challenging tasks can create social fears in the newcomers;
-  Since participants can have different technical backgrounds, the mentor should be monitor participants progress, and make sure they feel  challenged and motivated;
- Assigning a small task first and then challenging the newcomers with bigger tasks. Each task assigned to participants should take up to 3 hours to be completed (2 hours work outside the workshop is preferable). 
- Mentors should map how much each participant is looking to learn within a specific task, and adjust, if necessary, the tasks;
- If, for any reason, the participant cannot dedicate enough time to the activities proposed, the mentor should make adjustments;
- Mentors should communicate with the organization about struggles and difficulties faced by participants so we can adjust the tasks/deliverables to fit participants expectations
- Organization should analyse weekly the mentors and participants survey to identify improvements and use the data to refine the workshop planning

**Suggested Technical Content (For the Boilerplate Season):**

In this phase, the technical content is very intrinsic to the project being presented.
- Run locally the project
- Use it and feel see for themselves what is good and what is not
- Contribute to documentation (quick start, install, for example)


### Community Bonding
**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Goal:**
Now that the participants know the basics of contributing to OSS, it is time to contribute to one OSS project!
In this phase, we have a maintainer of a local OSS community guiding the participants through the process of contributing to a OSS community.
In community bonding, the maintainer will identify good first issues, reproduce bugs, discuss possible solutions,
walk through the contribution process
(implement a feature, test, open a pull request, communicate with the community, adjust contributions according to the feedback of reviewers),
and review participants' merge requests.
The goal is that each participant opens, at least, one pull request in this real OSS local community.
We encourage the use of a local OSS community to avoid language barrier (in our case portuguese), and to foster projects with a high impact on the local community.

**Success Metrics:**
- The participant contributes to the local OSS project (their pull request is accepted)
- The participants feel confident about their abilities to contribute to other OSS communities
- The participants feel motivated to contribute to OSS project/s
- The participant understand the benefits from contributing to OSS project (self-enhancement, building portfolio, being mentored, interesting projects)

**Tips:**
- Advise participants in choosing issues consistent with their abilities and career goals


### What'’ next? Finding your favorite OSS project to contribute
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Goal:**
The final 2 weeks of the BOSS initiative participants are introduced to other OSS communities.
In parallel with the final 2 weeks of the Community bonding phase, we have onboarding workshops from various OSS communities.
Participants can choose one or many workshops to attend. We invite mainterners
and contributors from different communities to lead these community bonding workshops.
It is a 4 hour workshop (all at once, or distributed in two weeks, according to the availability of the speaker),
with the goal to introduce the participants to a OSS community, the main features and roadmap,
the contribution workflow, and identify some good first issues.
Optionally, live codings can guide participants to configure locally the environment
(installation, test, dependencies) of the OSS project.
In these workshops, we hope to introduce the participants to a variety of OSS communities,
connect them with potential mentors from the communities, and encourage them to engage in the short/long term to contribute to Open Source.

**Success Metrics:**
- The little sibling participate at least one workshop
- The participant express interest in continue to contribute to Open Source
- They feel confident in pursuing their career goals ?
- As they  progress, their feelings of doubt should abate as their work and intelligence are validated over time.


## Talk like a boss

In parallel to the workshops and one-on-one mentorship, we have the Talk Like a BOSS.
It is a biweekly tematic live, and we discuss relevant topics of Software Engineering and Open Source,
inviting women from the industry/OSS community to share their perspective.
The goal of Talk Like a Boss is twofold.
First, we can discuss topics relevant to the software industry and OSS, from the perspective of under-representative groups.
Second, we employ the technique of recursive delegation, with the participants planning and leading the episodes.
The planning of Talk Like a Boss requires study the live topic, talk previously
to the guest to ajust the details about the live content, write the episode script,
with questions, guest bio, and finally, interact with the audience.


**Success Metrics:**
- The participants are engaged to participate to Talk like a BOSS

**Tips:**
- Have a script to guide participants in planning the live. Our talk like a boss script template can be found here
- Make sure the participants feel confident to lead the talk like a boss episode. Rehearse if necessary, review planning, give feedback
- Always have someone from the organization in the background, in case of any problem


## Ending of the program

The closure of the program is a moment to look back, see what can be refined,
and celebrate achievements.
Take this moment to ask for more feedback from everyone involved, about the program, the mentorship, the lectures.
Ask for the mentors about their mentees achievements, and what challenges they overcame.
Use them to make a presentation to appreciate everyone's efforts - big and little siblings, and organizers.
Use screenshots of repositories growth, amount of PRs and issues.
You can use the insights tab on github to generate charts.
