Selecting the mentors requires 4 weeks of preparation.
Two of them being the mentors applying period. (Applications open)

In the last week the mentors are selected and the results must be communicated.

There are some basic info you need to provide for people analyse if they are going to apply.

Do not forget to ask if they are available for this schedule.

The application form needs some basic information of the applicants,
such as social name, pronouns,
contact - email, phone number, telegram username, for example.
Being an inclusive and diverse program, we encourage having fields such as
race/ethnicity in the interest of selecting diverse people as an affirmative action.
Be responsible and research if there are terms in your language that might seem
innocent but might carry a disrespectful meaning torwards any group.

There are criteria for the choice of the mentors that will be specific to your context and project.
A few things to have in mind, how many mentors and participants in the program,
how diverse is your selection, the experience of the applicants.

what is the community that will be presented as example during the biggest part of the program,
